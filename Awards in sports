In India sports awards are presented by the Government of India to athletes and sports persons for their accomplishments and outstanding performances in the various fields of sports.
Initially, the Indian Government used to grant these awards to the athletes and sports persons for their excellent performances in all types of sport competitions. 
But, since 2001, the Sports awards are given only in those events that fall under the Olympic Games, Asian Games, Commonwealth Games, World Championship or the World Cup and also in Cricket. 
The awards are also given for the National level competitions and for Sports intended for the Physically Challenged.
